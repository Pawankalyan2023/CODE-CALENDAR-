# CodeCalendar

CodeCalendar is a platform designed to help coders keep track of upcoming coding contests. It displays contest times, event dates, and locations where contests are held. This could be your one-stop project if you're striving to create a coding culture in your day-to-day life and track it more efficiently and effectively.
We are an open-source projectâ€”feel free to raise queries and contribute to enhance the platform with more features!
